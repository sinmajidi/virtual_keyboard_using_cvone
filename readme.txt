hello every body
i used cv2 and cvzone for detect hands and fingers.
before any thing i want to tel more about cvzone,cvzone is a python library witch can detect hands and fingers motion.
the cvzone find hand and fingers in 20 points,20 points for right hand and 20points for left hand.
as you can see in hand.jpg file,cvzone know a hand and fingers using 20points.
in this programs,at the first in 3key.py i make 3 button and make the output for them and in virtual_keyboard_using_opencv.py i make entire keyboard and a field to output.


in the programs you can find:
lmList[8][0] and lmList[8][1]
it means the point finger for 2 hands,in order to hand.jpg you can replace the "8" with others to find other fingers.
